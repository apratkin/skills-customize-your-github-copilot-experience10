# 📘 Assignment: Statistics with Python

## 🎯 Objective

Learn fundamental statistical concepts and data analysis techniques using Python libraries like pandas and numpy. You'll work with real datasets to calculate statistics, explore patterns, and visualize insights.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Data Loading and Exploration

#### Description
Write a Python program that loads a CSV dataset and performs initial exploratory analysis. Use pandas to read data, examine its structure, and generate basic summary statistics.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Load a CSV file using pandas
- Display the first few rows and dataset shape
- Calculate and display descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Identify missing values and data types
- Provide a summary of the dataset


### 🛠️ Task 2: Statistical Analysis and Calculations

#### Description
Perform deeper statistical analysis on your dataset. Calculate correlations, create frequency distributions, and use numpy functions to extract meaningful insights from the data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Calculate correlation coefficients between numeric columns
- Create frequency distributions for categorical data
- Use numpy functions for mathematical operations
- Identify outliers using statistical methods
- Generate insight summaries from the analysis


### 🛠️ Task 3: Data Visualization

#### Description
Create visualizations of your data to communicate findings effectively. Use appropriate chart types to represent different aspects of your dataset.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create at least 3 different types of visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, etc.)
- Label axes and provide meaningful titles
- Use color to enhance readability
- Display statistical insights visually
- Save visualizations as image files
